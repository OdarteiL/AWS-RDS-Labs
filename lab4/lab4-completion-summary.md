# Lab 4 Completion Summary

**Lab:** Automated Backups and Point-in-Time Recovery  
**Completed:** September 3, 2025  
**Duration:** 40 minutes

## Key Achievements

✅ Configured automated backup settings (14-day retention)  
✅ Created manual snapshot successfully  
✅ Simulated data loss scenario  
✅ Performed point-in-time recovery  
✅ Verified data restoration

## Technical Skills Gained

- RDS backup configuration and management
- Manual snapshot creation and monitoring
- Point-in-time recovery procedures
- Data loss simulation and recovery testing
- Backup cost optimization understanding

## Important Concepts Learned

1. **Backup Types:**
   - Automated backups: Daily, retention-based, enable PITR
   - Manual snapshots: On-demand, persist until deleted

2. **Recovery Options:**
   - Point-in-time recovery creates new instance
   - Recovery limited to retention period
   - Requires transaction logs for granular recovery

3. **Cost Considerations:**
   - Backup storage costs scale with retention period
   - Manual snapshots incur ongoing storage costs
   - Automated backups included in instance pricing

## Next Steps

- Practice with different backup windows
- Test cross-region snapshot copying
- Explore automated backup lifecycle policies
- Consider implementing backup monitoring and alerting
